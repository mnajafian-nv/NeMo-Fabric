# Execution

NVIDIA NeMo Fabric exposes one consumer lifecycle and maps it onto an ordered
adapter-target lifecycle. A NeMo Fabric runtime is the isolation and correlation
boundary; it does not require a particular process, service, thread, or native
harness-session topology.

## Lifecycle

The abstract lifecycle contract contains these operations:

| Operation | Requirement | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `start(AgentConfig, RuntimeContext)` | Required | Initialize one isolated adapter-target runtime. |
| `invoke(AgentRunRequest, RuntimeContext)` | Preview, not negotiated | Future typed invocation boundary. The current binding uses its legacy request envelope and JSON-compatible output. |
| `stop(runtime_id)` | Required | Attempt to release all runtime resources, including after partial or failed execution. |
| `invoke_stream(...)` | NeMo Fabric-provided | Run ordinary `invoke` while NeMo Relay supplies correlated ATOF to the consumer. |
| `invoke_openai_stream(...)` | Reserved optional surface | A future native pass-through can expose only a declared OpenAI-compatible event profile. Other native stream formats are outside the contract. |
| `cancel(...)` | Reserved optional surface | Request cancellation of an active invocation when a runtime binding implements it. |
| `update(...)` | Reserved optional surface | Atomically apply declared updateable fields when a runtime binding implements it. |

The required ordering is one `start`, zero or more `invoke` operations, then
one `stop`, regardless of whether invoke uses the current binding or the future
typed boundary. The minimum profile permits only one active invocation in a
runtime. Adapters need not implement a queue or internal concurrency; consumers
start independent runtimes for parallel work.

Each operation produces one terminal response. An invocation-level failure
does not necessarily invalidate the runtime. A lifecycle or transport failure
can make it unusable, after which NeMo Fabric proceeds to cleanup rather than
replaying the request.

## Runtime Context

NeMo Fabric creates `RuntimeContext`; consumers and adapters must treat its IDs
as opaque correlation values.

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `runtime_id` | Correlates all operations in one Fabric runtime. |
| `invocation_id` | Identifies one invocation attempt. |
| `request_id` | Correlates the caller's request through Fabric and the adapter. |
| `environment` | Resolved workspace, artifact root, environment values, ownership, and provider context. |
| `artifacts` | Artifacts visible when the operation begins. |
| `telemetry` | Invocation telemetry context, including generated Relay config and environment when enabled. |

Use the generated
[`runtime-context.schema.json`](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Fabric/blob/main/schemas/adapter-contract/runtime-context.schema.json)
for the exact shape. Runtime/session identity belongs here, not in
`AgentConfig.workflow`; caller task context belongs in the invocation request.

## Relay Streaming

`Runtime.invoke_stream()` is the primary Fabric streaming API. It exposes raw,
invocation-correlated Agent Trajectory Observability Format (ATOF) records
generated through NeMo Relay. NeMo Fabric owns stream ingestion, correlation,
buffering, backpressure, and consumer stream lifecycle. The adapter continues
to execute its ordinary `invoke` operation.

The ATOF stream and terminal normalized result describe the same invocation,
but the result is obtained separately. An empty stream can still have a valid
terminal result. Stopping iteration or closing the consumer stream does not
cancel the target invocation.

The adapter reads Relay configuration and environment from
`RuntimeContext.telemetry` or uses the optional common adapter helpers. It does
not invent a second stream protocol.

## Current Python Host Binding

`nemo-fabric-adapters-common` is optional. Python adapters can use its
persistent line-oriented host instead of implementing the binding themselves:

```python
from nemo_fabric_adapter_contract.models import AgentConfig
from nemo_fabric_adapters.common import lifecycle


class ExampleRuntime:
    async def start(self, payload):
        config: AgentConfig = payload["agent_config"]

    async def invoke(self, payload):
        request = payload["request"]
        return {"answer": "..."}

    async def stop(self):
        pass


def main() -> None:
    lifecycle.serve(ExampleRuntime, config_model=AgentConfig)
```

The host validates the start `config` as `AgentConfig`, exposes that model as
`payload["agent_config"]`, serializes operations, normalizes lifecycle failures,
reserves stdout for its protocol, and attempts cleanup on EOF. It retains the
original mapping at `payload["config"]` for the shared utility accessors. The
adapter remains responsible for target-specific validation, translation, state,
and shutdown.

The lifecycle table describes the typed adapter contract, not the Python method
signatures. The common Python host passes one protocol payload to `start` and
`invoke`: during `start`, `payload["config"]` is the original wire mapping and
`payload["agent_config"]` is the validated `AgentConfig`. The protocol envelope
carries `RuntimeContext` and runtime identity. It calls `stop()` after resolving
the runtime identity from that envelope.

The current invoke payload contains `RuntimeContext` plus northbound
`RunRequest`, and accepts JSON-compatible output. `AgentRunRequest` and
`AgentRunResult` are preview-only and are not part of the negotiated contract.
Keep conversion at the edge of the adapter so adopting a future typed invoke
boundary does not affect target lifecycle code.
